ObraAfriTelc Telecom Data Warehouse

üìä Project Overview:

This project designs and implements a star-schema data warehouse for a fictional Sudanese telecom company, ObraAfriTelc. The solution ingests data from simulated operational systems (CRM, Billing, Network), transforms it through a staging layer, and loads it into an optimized dimensional model ready for analytics. The entire pipeline is built with custom T-SQL scripts on Microsoft SQL Server.

üéØ Business Objectives

To enable data-driven decision-making by providing a single source of truth for telecom metrics, including:
ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
Churn Rate Analysis
New Subscriber Acquisition
Revenue by Product and Region
Network Usage Analytics (MOU, Data Usage)
