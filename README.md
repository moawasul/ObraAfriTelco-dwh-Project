ObraAfriTelc Telecom Data Warehouse
üìä Project Overview
This project designs and implements a star-schema data warehouse for a fictional Sudanese telecom company, ObraAfriTelc. The solution ingests data from simulated operational systems (CRM, Billing, Network), transforms it through a staging layer, and loads it into an optimized dimensional model ready for analytics. The entire pipeline is built with custom T-SQL scripts on Microsoft SQL Server.

üéØ Business Objectives
To enable data-driven decision-making by providing a single source of truth for telecom metrics, including:

ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)

Churn Rate Analysis

New Subscriber Acquisition

Revenue by Product and Region

Network Usage Analytics (MOU, Data Usage)

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation
Data Stack
Database: Microsoft SQL Server

ETL: Custom T-SQL Scripts (Stored Procedures, MERGE statements)

Data Modeling: Kimball Star Schema

Visualization: Power BI

Key Features
Synthetic Data Generation: Scripts to create realistic, scalable data for 5,000+ customers with billing and usage records.

Incremental Load Design: ETL processes built with watermarking for efficient daily loads.

Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD): Type 2 implementation for dim_customer to track historical changes.

Data Quality Framework: Built-in checks for NULLs, duplicates, and referential integrity.


üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/your-username/telecom-data-warehouse.git

Run Scripts in Order: Execute the SQL scripts in numerical order from the /01_source_system directory.

Generate Data: Execute the synthetic data script to populate the source system.

Run ETL: Execute the staging and data warehouse ETL scripts to build the star schema.
